I embarked on the development of this app driven by a desire to delve deeper into the technologies I've been learning and to create a practical tool for my poker-loving friends and me. It has been a fulfilling journey challenging myself with unfamiliar technologies and concepts.

### Technologies Used

The app is built using a stack comprising PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, GraphQL, Websocket, and Redis.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

This project has been a tremendous learning experience. While I had some familiarity with basic GraphQL mutations and queries from previous projects, this app pushed me further. I implemented JWTs, Authmiddleware, and context to establish secure authentication practices. Additionally, I worked with a new data structure store called Redis to facilitate rapid in-game updates through a cached layer.

Opting to build the entire backend first before addressing the client side provided me with a comprehensive understanding of backend tools such as pgAdmin 4. I also extensively used the GraphQL-Apollo "Sandbox" for testing new queries and mutations, as well as a Jest testing suite for robust testing.

Collaborating with a partner on certain aspects through Github enhanced my understanding of workflow and Git version control. We also introduced Docker and Podman containers, a completely new experience for me.
