Plant People is one of my first full-stack projects that simply allows users to create an account and upload pictures of their favorite plants.

### Technologies Used

Handlebars, Bootstrap, Sequelize, Express, Heroku (for deployment)

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, which provided an opportunity to delve into the functionalities of the Handlebars template library. My main focus was on crafting an eye-catching homepage featuring a straightforward login/signup mechanism. Additionally, I implemented a feature allowing users to effortlessly upload pictures from their computer files and assign them a title and description before posting. Throughout this process, I gained valuable insights into deploying a project with a database to Heroku.
