{Prop} Bait boasts an extensive inventory of over 110 unique products, offering convenient filtering and sorting options by category, subcategory, price, and brand. The user experience is enhanced with an auto-fill search function that dynamically updates with each keystroke. The functional cart allows users to modify item quantities, triggering instant calculations for subtotals, shipping, and total costs. To complete the purchase, users can seamlessly check out and track their orders via the 'orders' tab in their account page.

### Technologies Used

Developed as a single-page React application, this platform employs a MERN stack, incorporating Apollo Client, GraphQL, and MUI libraries.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

This project marked one of my initial endeavors into creating a full-stack application from scratch. The process provided valuable insights into organization and workflow. Despite starting with a basic mock-up and simultaneously addressing front-end and back-end components, I acknowledge it might not have been the most efficient approach. Nonetheless, the end result exceeds my expectations. I gained substantial knowledge in crafting queries and mutations with GraphQL and creating reusable, dynamic components in React. The process of building components also deepened my understanding of utilizing 'state'.
